    "\n",
    "## Objective of this assignment\n",
    "The overall objective is to understand how frequent itemsets can be extracted by\n",
    "the Apriori algorithm and be able to calculate and interpret association rules in terms of support and confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ** Important: ** When handing in your homework:\n",
    "+ Hand in the notebook **(and nothing else)** named as follows: **StudentName1_snumber_StudentName2_snumber.ipynb**\n",
    "+ Provide clear and complete answers to the questions below under a separate header (not hidden somewhere in your source code), and make sure to explain your answers / motivate your choices. Add Markdown cells where necessary.\n",
    "+ Source code, output graphs, derivations, etc., should be included in the notebook.\n",
    "+ Hand-in: upload to Brightspace.\n",
    "+ Include name, student number, assignment (especially in filenames)!\n",
    "+ When working in pairs only one of you should upload the assignment, and report the name of your partner in your filename.\n",
    "+ Use the Brightspace discussion board or email the student assistants for questions on how to complete the exercises.\n",
